Linear_Algebra

This semester the topics of my linear Algebra Class have followed the following order:

1 - Systems of Linear Equations
2 - Matrix Multiplication and the Inverse
3 - Determinants
4 - Vector Spaces
5 - Eigen-everything

Something that I want to put together is a python supplement to learning linear algebra. I have found that many of the
students fail to make the connection between what is learned in the classroom and the real world applications.

For now, I will continue to use Numpy as a tool for Linear Algebra Calculations.
